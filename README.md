## Functionality

The IndiceChampion Expert Advisor is designed to analyze the Forex market and open trades based on market conditions. It is specifically programmed to open trades on the H1 timeframe for the Ger30 and S&P500 indices, as well as on the 5M timeframe for the US30 index.

The Expert Advisor uses market analysis to determine the trading conditions and opens trades accordingly. It places buy orders for the Ger30 and S&P500 indices on the H1 timeframe, and sell orders for the US30 index on the 5M timeframe.

The Expert Advisor also incorporates risk management features to protect against potential losses. If the account equity falls below 1000, it closes all open trades to minimize further losses.

## Usage

To use the IndiceChampion Expert Advisor, follow these steps:

1. Install the Expert Advisor on your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary indices available for trading (Ger30, S&P500, and US30).
3. Set the desired timeframe for trading (H1 for Ger30 and S&P500, and M5 for US30).
4. The Expert Advisor will automatically analyze the market conditions and open trades based on the specified criteria.
5. Monitor the trades and adjust risk management settings as needed.

Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and it is recommended to test the Expert Advisor on a demo account before using it with real funds.
